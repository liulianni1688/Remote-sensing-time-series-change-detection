# A Block-based change detection algorithm (MTS-GS. v1)
## Here is an Interactive example for Graph-based Segmentation for Multivariate Time Series algorithm (MTS-GS. v1)
This example is based on google earth engine, the requirements include:  
* python 3.7  
* os, datetime, math, pickle, operator, itertools   
* pandas, numpy  
* cv2, skimage, sklearn  
* matplotlib, seaborn  
* networkx  
* earthengine, geemap  
* our lib:  MTS_GS_LIB.cp37-win_amd64.pyd, please place it in the folder where the "main.ipynb" file resides   
  
After install the requirements, you can run the "main.ipynb" file to detect the block-based changes.  
  
Note that: Parameter adjustment is not supported in MTS-GS.v1.
